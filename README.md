Chef Christofell Menu App

A simple React Native application that allows users to view, filter, and search menu items by category.  
The app displays starters, mains, and desserts with their descriptions and prices in a clean, user-friendly interface.

I created an app for the chef and the guest so enable them to add new dishes according to their preferences and they are able to remove dishes that they no longer want. The also enables the chef to add new menu items on the app for the guest to choose from as well as their prices.

Part 1:
I designed the wireframes for the app as part of the planning the user design.

Part 2:
I had a one screen app that only allowed the user to add menu items on the app and it was able to display the menu items under starters, mains and desserts.

Part 3:
For my first page, I removed the imput text fields and replaced them with buttons for menu and to view the menu. I added two more screens for ManageMenu and FilterMenu where the chef is able to add menu items and enables the users to serches for the menu items they want.I also edited the filter screen for a better function.


Features

View all menu items (Starters, Mains, Desserts)  
Filter items by category using buttons  
Search for menu items by name  
Display average price information on the home screen  
 

How it works

The app uses three data arrays (mealName, description, and price) to the menu information.
Menu items are stored as objects in an array.
Filters are applied:
selected course– for filtering by category
search dish– for keyword searching
